github hello-world tutorial

Well, github tutorial says, i should write a bit about myself.

I am 30 years old, very interested in novel technical stuff and want to publish some coding in different languages here.
Its just for me, my projects and to learn more and more about coding with some suggestions from everyone.

Is this enough about me ? Mh, if not - aks me some more..

Greetings
